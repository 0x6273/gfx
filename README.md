# gfx-rs

A lightweight graphics device manager for Rust.

## Design Goals

- Lightweight implementation
- Minimal public API
- Low performance overhead
- Graphics API agnostic (OpenGL/DirectX)
- Maths library agnostic
- Clear documentation with examples

## Note

gfx-rs is still in the early stages of development. Help is most appreciated.
